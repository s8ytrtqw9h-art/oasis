            Universities need strong reputations to attract students, staff, and partners. Employee advocacy, when staff promote the university's achievements and values, helps build trust and credibility (Clark, Chapleo, & Suomi, 2019; Santos et al., 2023).
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Many African universities, including health sciences institutions, do not fully engage staff in advocacy due to limited communication or a lack of formal programs (Yaping et al., 2023).

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Employee advocacy is becoming a vital part of university branding in today's competitive higher-education environment, as staff who share positive stories and values can significantly enhance institutional reputation (Clark, Chapleo, & Suomi, 2019; Santos et al., 2023).
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            At Entrance University of Health Sciences (EUHS), it is unclear how employees actually take part in advocacy, how they perceive their role as ambassadors, or how much their efforts influence the institution's visibility and brand strength. Research suggests that weak internal communication and limited support for internal branding frequently undermine staff engagement in brand-related behaviors (Ahmed, Shakur, Hashim, & Ahmed, 2024).
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            These gaps may prevent EUHS from fully leveraging its employees' potential as authentic brand advocates. Therefore, this study investigates the types of advocacy undertaken by EUHS staff, the motivations and barriers they face, and how their advocacy shapes the university's public image.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-2">
              Employee advocacy refers to the voluntary promotion of an organization by its staff through both formal and informal channels (Van Camp, 2023). In universities, this includes sharing achievements on social media, recommending the institution to prospective students, defending university policies, and embodying institutional values in daily interactions.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-2">
              Employees are more likely to promote the university when their personal values match the institution's values (Clark, Chapleo, & Suomi, 2019). Value consonance strengthens connection to the brand and fosters employee-based brand equity (Yang et al., 2022). This alignment creates authentic advocacy that resonates more powerfully with external stakeholders than traditional marketing.

              Effective internal branding requires consistent communication, leadership support, and organizational culture that values employee contribution (Duh & Wara, 2023). African universities often face challenges in this area due to hierarchical structures and limited resources for internal communication programs.

              Most employee advocacy research focuses on Western contexts and digital advocacy. Limited studies examine non-digital advocacy or explore the phenomenon in African health sciences universities, where unique cultural and organizational factors may influence advocacy behaviors differently.

              Employees advocate when they feel valued, supported, and fairly treated. The theory posits that individuals engage in behaviors based on a cost-benefit analysis of their relationships. When universities invest in employees through recognition, development, and supportive environments, employees reciprocate through advocacy behaviors.

              Emotional and internal drives encourage voluntary advocacy behaviors. This self-determination theory suggests that when employees experience autonomy, competence, and relatedness in their work environment, they are intrinsically motivated to promote their organization without external rewards.
